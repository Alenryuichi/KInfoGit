# My 2025 Stack as a Frontend Developer

As a Frontend Developer in 2025, I've fine-tuned my development stack and now have three key tools that help me deliver better, faster and more maintainable projects.

## The Core Stack

### Next.js 15 - The Foundation
Next.js continues to be my go-to framework for React applications. With the latest version 15, we get:

- **App Router** - Better file-based routing
- **Server Components** - Improved performance
- **Turbopack** - Lightning-fast builds
- **TypeScript** - First-class support

```typescript
// Example of a modern Next.js component
import { Metadata } from 'next'

export const metadata: Metadata = {
  title: 'My Blog',
  description: 'Handpicked insights from the pensieve'
}

export default function BlogPage() {
  return (
    <div className="min-h-screen bg-black text-white">
      <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold">
        Handpicked insights from{' '}
        <span className="bg-gradient-to-r from-pink-500 to-purple-500 bg-clip-text text-transparent">
          the pensieve
        </span>
      </h1>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Tailwind CSS - Styling Made Simple
Tailwind CSS has revolutionized how I approach styling:

- **Utility-first** - No more CSS files
- **Responsive design** - Built-in breakpoints
- **Dark mode** - Easy theme switching
- **Custom design system** - Consistent spacing and colors

### TypeScript - Type Safety
TypeScript is no longer optional in 2025:

- **Better DX** - Autocomplete and error catching
- **Refactoring** - Safe code changes
- **Documentation** - Types as documentation
- **Team collaboration** - Shared interfaces

## Development Workflow

My typical development workflow in 2025:

1. **Planning** - Figma designs and user stories
2. **Setup** - Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind
3. **Development** - Component-driven development
4. **Testing** - Vitest and Testing Library
5. **Deployment** - Vercel for seamless CI/CD

## Key Learnings

After working with this stack for months, here are my key takeaways:

- **Start with TypeScript** - Don't add it later
- **Component libraries** - Build your own design system
- **Performance first** - Use Next.js optimizations
- **Mobile-first** - Always design for mobile

## Looking Forward

The frontend landscape keeps evolving, and I'm excited about:

- **React Server Components** - Better performance
- **Edge computing** - Faster global delivery
- **AI-assisted development** - GitHub Copilot integration
- **Web Assembly** - Performance-critical applications
